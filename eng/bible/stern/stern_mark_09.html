					<h3>Mark, Jewish New Testament and comment David H. Stern</h3>
						<div class="block">
						<p>
<b>chapter 9 </b><br>
1.	Yes!” he went on, “I tell you that there are some people standing here who will not experience death until they see the Kingdom of God come in a powerful way!” <br>
2. Six days later, Yeshua took Kefa, Ya‘akov and Yochanan and led them up a high mountain privately. As they watched, he began to change form,  <br>
3. and his clothes became dazzlingly white, whiter than anyone in the world could possibly bleach them. <br>
4. Then they saw Eliyahu and Moshe speaking with Yeshua. <br>
5. Kefa said to Yeshua, “It’s good that we’re here, Rabbi! Let’s put up three shelters — one for you, one for Moshe and one for Eliyahu.” <br>
6. (He didn’t know what to say, they were so frightened.) <br>
7. Then a cloud enveloped them; and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!” <br>
8. Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Yeshua. <br>
9. As they came down the mountain, he warned them not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead. <br>
10. So they kept the matter to themselves; but they continued asking each other, “What is this ‘rising from the dead’?” <br>
11. They also asked him, “Why do the Torah-teachers say that Eliyahu has to come first?” <br>
12. “Eliyahu will indeed come first,” he answered, “and he will restore everything. Nevertheless, why is it written in the Tanakh that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected? <br>
13. There’s more to it: I tell you that Eliyahu has come, and they did whatever they pleased to him, just as the Tanakh says about him.”
<br><span style="color: silver;">
SeeMt ll:10-14&N, 17:10-12&N.
</span><br><br>

14. When they got back to the talmidim, they saw a large crowd around them and some Torah-teachers arguing with them. <br>
15. As soon as the crowd saw him, they were surprised and ran out to greet him. <br>
16. He asked them, “What’s the discussion about?” <br>
17. One of the crowd gave him the answer: “Rabbi, I brought my son to you because he has an evil spirit in him that makes him unable to talk.  <br>
18. Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground — he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth and becomes stiff all over. I asked your talmidim to drive the spirit out, but they couldn’t do it.”<br>
19. “People without any trust!” he responded. “How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me!”<br>
20. They brought the boy to him; and as soon as the spirit saw him, it threw the boy into a convulsion. <br>
21. Yeshua asked the boy’s father, “How long has this been happening to him?” “Ever since childhood,” he said; <br>
22. “and it often tries to kill him by throwing him into the fire or into the water. But if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us!”  <br>
23. Yeshua said to him, “What do you mean, ‘if you can’? Everything is possible to someone who has trust!” <br>
24. Instantly the father of the child exclaimed, “I do trust — help my lack of trust!” <br>
25. When Yeshua saw that the crowd was closing in on them, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “You deaf and dumb spirit! I command you: come out of him, and never go back into him again!” <br>
26. Shrieking and throwing the boy into a violent fit, it came out. The boy lay there like a corpse, so that most of the people said he was dead.<br>
27. But Yeshua took him by the hand and raised him to his feet, and he stood up.<br>
28. After Yeshua had gone indoors, his talmidim asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” <br>
29. He said to them “This is the kind of spirit that can be driven out only by prayer.”
<br><span style="color: silver;">
Only by prayer. Some manuscripts add: "and fasting."
</span><br><br>
30. After leaving that place, they went on through the Galil. Yeshua didn’t want anyone to know, <br>
31. because he was teaching his talmidim. He told them, “The Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men who will put him to death; but after he has been killed, three days later he will rise.”<br>
32. But they didn’t understand what he meant, and they were afraid to ask him. <br>
33. They arrived at K’far-Nachum. When Yeshua was inside the house, he asked them, “What were you discussing as we were traveling?” <br>
34. But they kept quiet; because on the way, they had been arguing with each other about who was the greatest. <br>
35. He sat down, summoned the Twelve and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he must make himself last of all and servant of all.”<br>
36. He took a child and stood him among them. Then he put his arms around him and said to them, <br>
37.  “Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the One who sent me.” <br>
38. Yochanan said to him, “Rabbi, we saw a man expelling demons in your name; and because he wasn’t one of us, we told him to stop.”  <br>
39. But Yeshua said, “Don’t stop him, because no one who works a miracle in my name will soon after be able to say something bad about me. <br>
40. For whoever is not against us is for us.
<br><span style="color: silver;">
Whoever is not against us is for us. Apparently inconsistent with Mi 12:30, but see note there.
</span><br><br>

41. Indeed, whoever gives you even a cup of water to drink because you come in the name of the Messiah — yes! I tell you that he will certainly not lose his reward. <br>
42. “Whoever ensnares one of these little ones who trust me — it would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and be thrown in the sea. <br>
43. If your hand makes you sin, cut it off! Better that you should be maimed but obtain eternal life, rather than keep both hands and go to Gei-Hinnom, to unquenchable fire! 
<br><span style="color: silver;">
Gey-Hinnom ("Gehenna," "hell"). See Mt 5:22N.<br>
Some manuscripts include identical verses 44 and 46: <b>where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched</b>. (Isaiah 66:24)
</span><br><br>
45. And if your foot makes you sin, cut it off! Better that you should be lame but obtain eternal life, rather than keep both feet and be thrown into <i>Gei-Hinnom</i>!<br>
<span style="color: silver;">
Some manuscripts include identical verses 44 and 46: <b>where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched</b>. (Isaiah 66:24)
</span><br><br>
47. And if your eye makes you sin, pluck it out! Better that you should be one-eyed but enter the Kingdom of God, rather than keep both eyes and be thrown into <i>Gei-Hinnom,</i> <br>
48. <b>where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched</b>  (Isaiah 66:24)
<br><span style="color: silver;">
Isaiah 66:22-24 teaches the existence of a "new heaven and a new earth" (confirmed in 2 Ke 3:13, Revelation 21-22), in which God's people will worship him, "and they will go forth and look upon the carcasses of those who have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, and their fire will not be quenched."
</span><br><br>

49. Indeed, everyone is going to be salted with fire. <br>
50. Salt is excellent, but if it loses its saltiness, how will you season it? So have salt in yourselves — that is, be at peace with each other.”
<br><span style="color: silver;">
Salt is used to season (Co 4:5-6&N) and as a preservative, producing permanence (Mt 5:13—14&N). "It is forbidden to offer any sacrifice without salt" (Rambam, The Commandments, Negative Commandment #99; see Leviticus 2:13); hence it is appropriate for talmidim, who are to offer themselves as living sacrifices (Ro 12:1-2), to be salted with fire. Observant Jews sprinkle salt on bread before reciting the b 'rakhah over it (Mt 14:19N); this follows from the rabbinic equating of the home dining table with the Temple altar (7:2-4&N). See Lk 14:34-35N.
